- **Secure Data Management:**  
  - Real-time data interactions.  
  - SQL injection prevention.  
  - Secure form validation (client-side and server-side).  

- **Advanced Database Features:**  
  - ACID compliance for transactional integrity.  
  - Implementation of stored procedures and triggers to automate database operations.
